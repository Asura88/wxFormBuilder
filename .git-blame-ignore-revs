# Since Git 2.23 git-blame has a feature to ignore certain commits that is useful
# for uninteresting commits like mass reformatting. This file contains a list of
# such commits, it can be used either as parameter for git blame --ignore-revs-file
# or it can be set as default ignore file for the repository with the following command:
#
#   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

# Reformat XML files and code templates
